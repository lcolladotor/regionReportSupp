`regionReport` supplementary website
====================================

This is the supplementary website for the `regionReport` paper. It contains the reports for three different data sets as described in the `derfinder` paper [bioRxiv preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/19/015370).

The three reports can be viewed following these links:

* [brainspan](/brainspan/basicExploration.html)
* [hippo](/hippo/basicExploration.html)
* [simulation](/simulation/basicExploration.html)

Note that each report is around 40-50 MB in size and can take some time to load.

The code used for generating these reports is available at the `derfinder` paper [bioRxiv preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/19/015370) supplementary website [derSoftware](http://lcolladotor.github.io/regionReportSupp/).
